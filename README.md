# LegoHouse
Web Project where you can order a bill of materials for a lego house of any given dimensions. Includes login/registration functionality.

## Description

This is an educational project. It was created due to it being a prerequisite to the entrance of an exam.
The project involves a scenario where a firm has tasked programmers to create a website.

The purpose is to gain understanding of:
* The concept of backend and frontend programming.
* Connecting to and using droplets, herein deployment of .war files on a server.
* Retrieval and removal of SQL data on a MySQL database located on a server.
* Architecture and design principles, including multi-layer architecture (data, logic and presentation layers).

Furthermore, the project includes introductions to: HTML, CSS, .jsp sites and more.

### How to test

An example of the deployed .war file can be accessed here:

**To test the admin status use the following account:** 

username = admin

password = 66654321

Otherwise, simply register as a user and log in using that.

### Documentation

An ER model and a SQL generation script for the database structure has been included in the Diagrams folder in this repository.

Javadoc is currently not available for this project as I simply didn't have enough time to write it.

This javadoc for the similar Cupcake Webshop project will help understand the general structure and design of the program though.
